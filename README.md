## PixelMatchSwitcher
When streaming games, OBS can auto switch the scene configuation based on the currently active window title.. However, it is often desirable to switch the scene configuration based on what part of the game is being displayed in the UI, even when the window title is always the same.

Two reasons this are useful are. (a) streamers often like to have displays with a bigger streamer-cam and/or ads when they are in a game menu, or some other “non gameplay” area of the game. (b) streamers often need to *hide* certain elements of game content, so they don’t get stream-sniped by people who want to gain an advantage by watching their stream while playing against them.  Currently, streamers handle these cases manually, by manually switching scenes everytime, either with the OBS UI or by assigning hotkeys.

Pixel Match Switcher plugin makes this scene switching automatic.
